Chris' Steamed Buns
-------------------

Time: 4 hours

1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour



3. Knead until dough surface is smooth and elastic. Roll over in a greased bowl, and let stand until triple in size, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
4. Punch down dough, and spread out on a floured board.
5. Sprinkle baking powder evenly on surface, and knead for 5 minutes.
8. Bring water to a boil in wok, and reduce heat to medium; the water should still be boiling.
10. Transfer as many buns on wax paper as will comfortably fit onto steam-plate leaving 1 to 2 inches between the buns. At least 2 inches space should be left between steam-plate and the wok.
